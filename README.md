# Project 3: From Portland to Portland

### Overview
This is a website logging a journey from Portland, Maine to Portland, Oregon.  In this project I combined skills learned in previous sprints as well as new ones.  I learned about Figma, images, and more git.

**Old Skills**

The old skills I used for this project are my knowledge of positioning, z-index, display-flex, hover transitions, and BEM methodology.

**New Skills**

@media queries, display-grid, and branches on git are some of the new skills I had to understand to finish this project.  At first, @media queries were difficult to grasp.  I found grid to be intuitive and enjoyed working with it.  Due to a git error, I lost 10+ hours of work on my project however, I painfully learned what not to do and won't likely make that error again.  

**Figma and Extensions**

Through this project I have become acquainted with Figma.  I learned how to check the properties of each element.  I also learned how to check my project with pixel perfect chrome extension.

**Images**

For the images on the site I had to export them from Figma and optimize them through [Tiny PNG](https://tinypng.com/), so that they would load faster.  

**Conclusion**

It was a pleasure to work on this project and further my knowledge of CSS and HTML as well as best practices within the industry.  Thank you for reading.
